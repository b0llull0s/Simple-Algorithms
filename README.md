>Without being able to measure progress, it's difficult to formulate a strategy.
- Here there are some simple algorithms that may be useful to find analogies with real life situations.
>[!IMPORTANT] 
>- **Constrains**: Unbreakable rules about the problem or the way in which the problem must be solved.
>- **Operations**: Generic or parameterized actions that you can do to solved a problem.
>- **Analogy**: An exploitable similarity betwen a solved problem and an unsolved problem. 

# Problem-Solving Techniques (in any order)
- Always have a plan.
- Restate the problem.
- Divide the problem.
- Reduce the scope of the problem.
- Look for Analogies.
- Reflect the problem.
- Experiment.
